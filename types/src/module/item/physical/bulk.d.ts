     * if item size < creature size:
     * for each step until you reach the target size halve bulk
     * 1 bulk halved becomes L bulk
     * L bulk halved becomes negligible bulk
     *
     * if item size > creature size:
     * for each step until you reach the target size double bulk
     * L bulk doubled becomes 1 bulk
     * negligible bulk doubled becomes L bulk unless it's a tiny item, then it stays at negligible bulk
